## Kubernetes Fundamentals

### Q1: Explain the core Kubernetes architecture and how it differs from Docker Compose

**Your Experience:** "Having deployed my Shortly application from Docker Compose to EKS..."

**Technical Answer:**
Kubernetes architecture consists of control plane and worker nodes, fundamentally different from Docker Compose:

**Control Plane Components:**
- **API Server:** Central communication hub for all operations
- **etcd:** Distributed database storing cluster state
- **Scheduler:** Decides pod placement based on resources and constraints
- **Controller Manager:** Ensures desired state matches actual state

**Worker Node Components:**
- **kubelet:** Node agent managing pods and containers
- **Container Runtime:** Docker/containerd for running containers
- **kube-proxy:** Network routing and load balancing

**Key Differences from Docker Compose:**
```yaml
# Docker Compose (Single Host)
services:
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    replicas: 3  # Limited to one host

# Kubernetes (Multi-Host Cluster)
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: backend
spec:
  replicas: 3  # Distributed across cluster nodes
```

**My Real Implementation:**
"In my EKS cluster, I have a managed control plane and 2 t3.medium worker nodes. My backend deployment with 3 replicas gets distributed across these nodes automatically, unlike Docker Compose which runs all containers on a single EC2 instance."

**Enterprise Benefits:**
- **High Availability:** Control plane and workloads distributed
- **Auto-healing:** Failed pods automatically replaced
- **Declarative Management:** Desired state continuously maintained
- **Resource Efficiency:** Intelligent scheduling across cluster

---

### Q2: What are the differences between Pods, Deployments, and Services?

**Your Experience:** "In my Shortly EKS deployment, I implemented all three..."

**Technical Answer:**
These are the core Kubernetes primitives with distinct responsibilities:

**Pods (Smallest Deployable Unit):**
```yaml
# Pod wraps one or more containers
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: backend-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: backend
    image: 515966507719.dkr.ecr.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/shortly-backend:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 8000
```

**Deployments (Lifecycle Management):**
```yaml
# Deployment manages multiple pod replicas
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: backend
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: backend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: backend
        image: 515966507719.dkr.ecr.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/shortly-backend:latest
```

**Services (Network Access):**
```yaml
# Service provides stable endpoint
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: backend
spec:
  selector:
    app: backend
  ports:
  - port: 8000
    targetPort: 8000
  type: ClusterIP
```

**Real-World Hierarchy:**
```
Service (backend) → Load balances to → Deployment (backend) → Manages → Pods (3 replicas)
```

**My Implementation:**
- **Pods:** Individual container instances of my FastAPI backend
- **Deployment:** Ensures 3 backend pods always running, handles rolling updates
- **Service:** Provides stable `backend.shortly.svc.cluster.local` endpoint for frontend

**Why Not Use Pods Directly:**
"Pods are ephemeral - they can die and restart with new IPs. Deployments provide self-healing and scaling, while Services provide stable network endpoints."

---

### Q3: How does Kubernetes networking work, and what service types are available?

**Your Experience:** "When connecting my Shortly components in Kubernetes..."

**Technical Answer:**
Kubernetes networking operates on several layers with different service types:

**Cluster Networking Model:**
- **Pod-to-Pod:** Direct communication via cluster network (10.244.0.0/16)
- **Service Discovery:** DNS-based resolution (`backend.shortly.svc.cluster.local`)
- **Load Balancing:** Automatic traffic distribution across pod replicas

**Service Types Implemented:**

**1. ClusterIP (Internal Communication):**
```yaml
# Backend and Redis services
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: backend
  namespace: shortly
spec:
  selector:
    app: backend
  ports:
  - port: 8000
    targetPort: 8000
  type: ClusterIP  # Only accessible within cluster
```

**2. LoadBalancer (External Access):**
```yaml
# Frontend service for external traffic
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: frontend
  namespace: shortly
spec:
  selector:
    app: frontend
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  type: LoadBalancer  # Creates AWS ALB/NLB
```

**My Network Architecture:**
```
Internet → ALB (LoadBalancer) → Frontend Pods → backend.shortly:8000 → Backend Pods → redis.shortly:6379 → Redis Pod
```

**Service Discovery in Action:**
```python
# Backend connects to Redis via service name
REDIS_HOST = os.getenv("REDIS_HOST", "redis")  # Resolves to Redis service IP
```

**Real Implementation:**
"My frontend pods call `http://backend:8000/api` which gets load-balanced across 3 backend pods automatically. The backend pods connect to `redis:6379` which resolves to the Redis service."

---

## Container Orchestration Concepts

### Q4: How does Kubernetes handle container scaling and self-healing?

**Your Experience:** "I implemented both manual scaling and Horizontal Pod Autoscaler..."

**Technical Answer:**
Kubernetes provides multiple layers of scaling and self-healing:

**Manual Scaling:**
```bash
# Scale deployment replicas
kubectl scale deployment backend --replicas=5 -n shortly

# Verify scaling
kubectl get pods -n shortly | grep backend
```

**Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA):**
```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: backend-hpa
  namespace: shortly
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: backend
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: memory
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 80
```

**Self-Healing Mechanisms:**
1. **Pod Replacement:** Failed pods automatically recreated
2. **Health Checks:** Liveness probes restart unhealthy containers
3. **Readiness Probes:** Remove unhealthy pods from service endpoints
4. **Node Failure:** Pods rescheduled to healthy nodes

**My Real Implementation:**
```yaml
# Health checks in backend deployment
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8000
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
  periodSeconds: 30

readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8000
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 10
```

**Load Testing for HPA:**
"I created a CPU-intensive `/load-test` endpoint that performs 100,000 mathematical operations to trigger HPA scaling when under load."

---

### Q5: What is the difference between StatefulSets and Deployments?

**Your Experience:** "I used Deployments for stateless services and considered StatefulSets for Redis..."

**Technical Answer:**
The choice depends on application state requirements:

**Deployments (Stateless Applications):**
```yaml
# Backend deployment - stateless
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: backend
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: backend
        image: shortly-backend:latest
        # No persistent storage needed
```

**StatefulSets (Stateful Applications):**
```yaml
# Redis StatefulSet example (alternative to Deployment)
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: redis
spec:
  serviceName: redis
  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: redis
        image: redis:7-alpine
        volumeMounts:
        - name: redis-storage
          mountPath: /data
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: redis-storage
    spec:
      accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 10Gi
```

**Key Differences:**

| **Aspect** | **Deployment** | **StatefulSet** |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Pod Names** | Random (backend-abc123) | Ordered (redis-0, redis-1) |
| **Storage** | Shared or none | Unique per pod |
| **Scaling** | Parallel | Sequential (ordered) |
| **Updates** | Rolling (any order) | Sequential (ordered) |
| **Use Cases** | Web servers, APIs | Databases, caches |

**My Decision:**
"I used a Deployment for Redis with a single replica and PersistentVolumeClaim because I only needed one Redis instance. For a Redis cluster, I would use StatefulSet for stable pod identities and persistent storage per pod."

---

## EKS and Cloud-Native Deployment

### Q6: How did you set up your EKS cluster and what components are involved?

**Your Experience:** "I deployed my Shortly application to EKS using Terraform..."

**Technical Answer:**
EKS cluster setup involves multiple AWS components working together:

**Infrastructure Components (Terraform-managed):**
```hcl
# EKS Cluster
resource "aws_eks_cluster" "shortly_cluster" {
  name     = "shortly-cluster"
  role_arn = aws_iam_role.eks_cluster_role.arn
  version  = "1.28"

  vpc_config {
    subnet_ids              = [aws_subnet.public_1.id, aws_subnet.public_2.id]
    endpoint_private_access = false
    endpoint_public_access  = true
  }
}

# Managed Node Group
resource "aws_eks_node_group" "shortly_nodes" {
  cluster_name    = aws_eks_cluster.shortly_cluster.name
  node_group_name = "shortly-nodes"
  node_role_arn   = aws_iam_role.eks_node_role.arn
  subnet_ids      = [aws_subnet.public_1.id, aws_subnet.public_2.id]

  instance_types = ["t3.medium"]
  ami_type       = "AL2_x86_64"

  scaling_config {
    desired_size = 2
    max_size     = 4
    min_size     = 1
  }
}
```

**EKS Add-ons Configuration:**
```hcl
# Essential add-ons for functionality
resource "aws_eks_addon" "vpc_cni" {
  cluster_name = aws_eks_cluster.shortly_cluster.name
  addon_name   = "vpc-cni"
}

resource "aws_eks_addon" "coredns" {
  cluster_name = aws_eks_cluster.shortly_cluster.name
  addon_name   = "coredns"
}

resource "aws_eks_addon" "ebs_csi_driver" {
  cluster_name = aws_eks_cluster.shortly_cluster.name
  addon_name   = "aws-ebs-csi-driver"
  service_account_role_arn = aws_iam_role.ebs_csi_role.arn
}
```

**Cluster Access Configuration:**
```bash
# Configure kubectl for EKS
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-west-1 --name shortly-cluster

# Verify cluster access
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -A
```

**My Real Deployment:**
- **Control Plane:** Managed by AWS (no server management)
- **Worker Nodes:** 2 t3.medium instances across 2 AZs
- **Networking:** Custom VPC with public subnets and NAT gateway
- **Storage:** EBS CSI driver for persistent volumes
- **Container Registry:** Private ECR repositories for backend/frontend images

---

### Q7: What issues did you encounter with EKS and how did you solve them?

**Your Experience:** "I faced several production challenges during my EKS deployment..."

**Technical Answer:**
Real-world EKS deployments involve complex troubleshooting:

**1. EBS CSI Driver Issue:**
```bash
# Problem: PersistentVolumeClaim stuck in Pending state
kubectl get pvc -n shortly
# redis-data   Pending

# Root Cause: Missing EBS CSI driver add-on
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep ebs-csi
# No EBS CSI driver pods found

# Solution: Install EBS CSI driver add-on
aws eks create-addon \
  --cluster-name shortly-cluster \
  --addon-name aws-ebs-csi-driver \
  --service-account-role-arn arn:aws:iam::515966507719:role/AmazonEKS_EBS_CSI_DriverRole
```

**2. OIDC Provider Configuration:**
```bash
# Problem: Service account role not working
# Error: "AccessDenied: User: system:serviceaccount:kube-system:ebs-csi-controller-sa is not authorized"

# Solution: Create OIDC identity provider
aws iam create-open-id-connect-provider \
  --url https://oidc.eks.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/id/3F9EB5076A2703FE770C02BFACC12B61 \
  --thumbprint-list 9e99a48a9960b14926bb7f3b02e22da2b0ab7280 \
  --client-id-list sts.amazonaws.com
```

**3. Service Account Annotation:**
```yaml
# Problem: EBS CSI controller couldn't assume IAM role
# Solution: Annotate service account with role ARN
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: ebs-csi-controller-sa
  namespace: kube-system
  annotations:
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::515966507719:role/AmazonEKS_EBS_CSI_DriverRole
```

**4. Frontend Permission Issues:**
```yaml
# Problem: nginx permission denied on port 80
# Root Cause: Non-root user can't bind to privileged ports

# Solution: Change to unprivileged port
containers:
- name: frontend
  image: shortly-frontend:latest
  ports:
  - containerPort: 8080  # Changed from 80
```

**Systematic Troubleshooting Approach:**
1. **Check resource status:** `kubectl get pods,pvc,events -n shortly`
2. **Examine logs:** `kubectl logs deployment/backend -n shortly`
3. **Inspect resources:** `kubectl describe pod backend-xxx -n shortly`
4. **Test connectivity:** `kubectl exec -it backend-xxx -- curl redis:6379`
5. **Review AWS resources:** EKS console, CloudTrail logs

## Production Operations

### Q8: How do you manage configuration and secrets in Kubernetes?

**Your Experience:** "I implemented both ConfigMaps and Secrets for my Shortly application..."

**Technical Answer:**
Kubernetes provides native configuration management with security best practices:

**ConfigMaps for Non-Sensitive Data:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: backend-config
  namespace: shortly
data:
  REDIS_HOST: "redis"
  REDIS_PORT: "6379"
  REDIS_DB: "0"
  BASE_URL: "https://shortly-somesh.duckdns.org"
  LOG_LEVEL: "INFO"
```

**Secrets for Sensitive Data:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: backend-secrets
  namespace: shortly
type: Opaque
data:
  REDIS_PASSWORD: <base64-encoded-password>
  JWT_SECRET_KEY: <base64-encoded-secret>
```

**Using Configuration in Deployments:**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: backend
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: backend
        image: shortly-backend:latest
        envFrom:
        - configMapRef:
            name: backend-config
        - secretRef:
            name: backend-secrets
        # Individual environment variables
        env:
        - name: ENVIRONMENT
          value: "production"
```

**Advanced Secret Management:**
```yaml
# External Secrets Operator (for AWS Secrets Manager)
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: SecretStore
metadata:
  name: aws-secrets-manager
spec:
  provider:
    aws:
      service: SecretsManager
      region: us-west-1
```

**My Implementation Strategy:**
- **ConfigMaps:** Application settings, feature flags, non-sensitive URLs
- **Secrets:** Database passwords, API keys, certificates
- **Environment-specific:** Different ConfigMaps per namespace (dev/staging/prod)
- **Immutable ConfigMaps:** Prevent accidental modifications in production

**Security Best Practices:**
- **Least Privilege:** RBAC controls who can access secrets
- **Encryption at Rest:** etcd encryption for secret storage
- **Secret Rotation:** Regular updates to credentials
- **External Secret Management:** Integration with AWS Secrets Manager

---

### Q9: How do you handle persistent storage in Kubernetes?

**Your Experience:** "I implemented persistent storage for Redis using EBS volumes..."

**Technical Answer:**
Kubernetes persistent storage involves multiple components working together:

**Storage Architecture:**
```
PersistentVolumeClaim → PersistentVolume → StorageClass → EBS Volume
```

**StorageClass (Infrastructure Definition):**
```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: gp2
provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com
parameters:
  type: gp2
  fsType: ext4
allowVolumeExpansion: true
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
```

**PersistentVolumeClaim (Storage Request):**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: redis-data
  namespace: shortly
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
  storageClassName: gp2
```

**Pod Volume Mount:**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: redis
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: redis
        image: redis:7-alpine
        volumeMounts:
        - name: redis-storage
          mountPath: /data
      volumes:
      - name: redis-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: redis-data
```

**Access Modes and Use Cases:**
- **ReadWriteOnce (RWO):** Single node access (databases, caches)
- **ReadOnlyMany (ROX):** Multiple nodes read-only (static content)
- **ReadWriteMany (RWX):** Multiple nodes read-write (shared filesystems)

**My Real Implementation:**
```bash
# Verify storage provisioning
kubectl get pvc,pv -n shortly
# NAME                              STATUS   VOLUME                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
# persistentvolumeclaim/redis-data   Bound    pvc-abc123-def456          10Gi       RWO            gp2            2d

# Check EBS volume in AWS
aws ec2 describe-volumes --filters "Name=tag:kubernetes.io/created-for/pvc/name,Values=redis-data"
```

**Storage Challenges Solved:**
1. **EBS CSI Driver:** Required for dynamic provisioning
2. **Service Account Permissions:** IAM role for EBS operations
3. **AZ Constraints:** Volumes bound to specific availability zones
4. **Performance:** gp3 for better IOPS and throughput

## Auto-scaling & Resource Management

### Q10: How does Horizontal Pod Autoscaler work and how did you implement it?

**Your Experience:** "I configured HPA for both backend and frontend with CPU and memory metrics..."

**Technical Answer:**
HPA automatically scales pods based on observed metrics and defined policies:

**HPA Configuration:**
```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: backend-hpa
  namespace: shortly
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: backend
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: memory
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 80
  behavior:
    scaleUp:
      stabilizationWindowSeconds: 60
      policies:
      - type: Percent
        value: 100
        periodSeconds: 15
    scaleDown:
      stabilizationWindowSeconds: 300
      policies:
      - type: Percent
        value: 10
        periodSeconds: 60
```

**Resource Requirements (Essential for HPA):**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: backend
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 250m      # 0.25 CPU cores
            memory: 256Mi  # 256 megabytes
          limits:
            cpu: 500m      # 0.5 CPU cores
            memory: 512Mi  # 512 megabytes
```

**Load Testing for HPA Validation:**
```python
# CPU-intensive endpoint I created
@app.get("/load-test")
def cpu_intensive_endpoint():
    start_time = time.time()
    result = 0
    
    for i in range(100000):  # CPU-intensive operations
        result += i ** 2
        result = result % 1000000
        
        # String operations
        text = f"load-test-{i}"
        hash_value = hashlib.sha256(text.encode()).hexdigest()
    
    return {
        "duration_seconds": round(time.time() - start_time, 3),
        "iterations": 100000,
        "final_result": result
    }
```

**HPA Monitoring Commands:**
```bash
# Check HPA status
kubectl get hpa -n shortly

# Watch HPA scaling decisions
kubectl describe hpa backend-hpa -n shortly

# Monitor resource usage
kubectl top pods -n shortly
```

**My HPA Implementation Results:**
- **Backend HPA:** Scales 2-10 replicas based on 70% CPU, 80% memory
- **Frontend HPA:** Scales 2-6 replicas based on 60% CPU, 70% memory
- **Load Testing:** Created aggressive load tests to trigger scaling
- **Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring scripts to observe scaling behavior

**HPA Decision Algorithm:**
```
desiredReplicas = ceil[currentReplicas * (currentMetricValue / desiredMetricValue)]
```

### Q11: What is Cluster Autoscaler and how does it relate to HPA?

**Your Experience:** "While HPA scales pods, I learned about cluster-level scaling..."

**Technical Answer:**
Cluster Autoscaler works at the infrastructure level, complementing HPA:

**Three-Layer Auto-scaling Architecture:**
```
1. Application Level → HPA → Scales Pods
2. Infrastructure Level → Cluster Autoscaler → Scales Nodes  
3. Cloud Level → Auto Scaling Groups → Manages EC2 Instances
```

**Cluster Autoscaler Configuration:**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: cluster-autoscaler
  namespace: kube-system
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: registry.k8s.io/autoscaling/cluster-autoscaler:v1.28.0
        name: cluster-autoscaler
        command:
        - ./cluster-autoscaler
        - --v=4
        - --stderrthreshold=info
        - --cloud-provider=aws
        - --skip-nodes-with-local-storage=false
        - --expander=least-waste
        - --node-group-auto-discovery=asg:tag=k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/enabled,k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/shortly-cluster
```

**Auto Scaling Group Integration:**
```hcl
# Terraform configuration for CA
resource "aws_autoscaling_group" "eks_nodes" {
  name                = "shortly-cluster-nodes"
  vpc_zone_identifier = [aws_subnet.public_1.id, aws_subnet.public_2.id]
  target_group_arns   = []
  health_check_type   = "EC2"
  
  min_size         = 1
  max_size         = 4
  desired_capacity = 2
  
  tag {
    key                 = "k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/enabled"
    value               = "true"
    propagate_at_launch = false
  }
  
  tag {
    key                 = "k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/shortly-cluster"
    value               = "owned"
    propagate_at_launch = false
  }
}
```

**Scaling Scenarios:**

**Scale Up Trigger:**
```
1. HPA increases pod replicas due to high CPU
2. Pods remain Pending (insufficient node capacity)
3. Cluster Autoscaler detects pending pods
4. New EC2 instances launched
5. Pods scheduled on new nodes
```

**Scale Down Trigger:**
```
1. HPA decreases pod replicas due to low CPU
2. Node utilization drops below threshold
3. Cluster Autoscaler cordons and drains node
4. EC2 instance terminated
5. Cost reduced
```

**My Current Setup:**
"I have manual node management with 2 t3.medium instances. In production, I would implement Cluster Autoscaler to automatically adjust node capacity based on pod scheduling needs."

## Security & Best Practices

### Q12: What security measures did you implement in your Kubernetes deployment?

**Your Experience:** "I implemented multiple security layers in my EKS deployment..."

**Technical Answer:**
Kubernetes security requires defense-in-depth across multiple layers:

**1. Pod Security Context:**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true
        runAsUser: 1000
        fsGroup: 1000
      containers:
      - name: backend
        securityContext:
          allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
          readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
          capabilities:
            drop:
            - ALL
```

**2. RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):**
```yaml
# Service account for applications
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: shortly-backend-sa
  namespace: shortly

# Role with minimal permissions
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: backend-role
  namespace: shortly
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["configmaps", "secrets"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]

# Bind role to service account
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: backend-rolebinding
  namespace: shortly
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: shortly-backend-sa
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: backend-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

**3. Network Policies:**
```yaml
# Restrict Redis access to backend only
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: redis-access-policy
  namespace: shortly
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: redis
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: backend
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 6379
```

**4. Resource Quotas and Limits:**
```yaml
# Namespace resource limits
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: shortly-quota
  namespace: shortly
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "2"
    requests.memory: 4Gi
    limits.cpu: "4"
    limits.memory: 8Gi
    persistentvolumeclaims: "2"
```

**5. Secret Management:**
```yaml
# Encrypted secrets with proper RBAC
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: backend-secrets
  namespace: shortly
type: Opaque
data:
  redis-password: <base64-encoded>
immutable: true  # Prevent modifications
```

**Real Security Implementation:**
- **Non-root containers:** All applications run as user ID 1000
- **Read-only filesystems:** Prevent container tampering
- **Dropped capabilities:** Remove unnecessary Linux capabilities
- **Resource limits:** Prevent resource exhaustion attacks
- **Network segmentation:** Isolate services with NetworkPolicies

**EKS-Specific Security:**
- **IAM integration:** Service accounts with AWS IAM roles
- **VPC networking:** Private subnets for worker nodes
- **Security groups:** Network-level access control
- **Encryption:** etcd encryption at rest enabled

## Troubleshooting & Problem Solving

### Q13: Walk me through a complex Kubernetes issue you resolved

**Your Experience:** "I encountered a critical PersistentVolumeClaim issue that required deep EKS troubleshooting..."

**STAR Method Answer:**

**Situation:** "While deploying my Redis database to EKS, I encountered a critical issue where the PersistentVolumeClaim remained stuck in 'Pending' state, preventing the Redis pod from starting and blocking my entire application deployment."

**Task:** "I needed to diagnose why Kubernetes couldn't provision the EBS volume for persistent storage and restore the Redis service to get my URL shortener application fully operational."

**Action:**
1. **Initial Investigation:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get pvc,pv -n shortly
   # redis-data   Pending   
   
   kubectl describe pvc redis-data -n shortly
   # Events: waiting for a volume to be created
   ```

2. **Discovered Missing EBS CSI Driver:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep ebs-csi
   # No EBS CSI driver pods found
   
   aws eks describe-cluster --name shortly-cluster --query 'cluster.version'
   # "1.28" - EBS CSI driver not included by default
   ```

3. **Attempted CSI Driver Installation:**
   ```bash
   aws eks create-addon --cluster-name shortly-cluster --addon-name aws-ebs-csi-driver
   # Error: Service account doesn't have required permissions
   ```

4. **Created OIDC Provider and IAM Role:**
   ```bash
   # Extract OIDC issuer URL
   aws eks describe-cluster --name shortly-cluster --query "cluster.identity.oidc.issuer" --output text
   
   # Create OIDC identity provider
   aws iam create-open-id-connect-provider \
     --url https://oidc.eks.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/id/3F9EB5076A2703FE770C02BFACC12B61 \
     --thumbprint-list 9e99a48a9960b14926bb7f3b02e22da2b0ab7280 \
     --client-id-list sts.amazonaws.com
   ```

5. **Configured Service Account with Role ARN:**
   ```bash
   kubectl annotate serviceaccount ebs-csi-controller-sa \
     -n kube-system \
     eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn=arn:aws:iam::515966507719:role/AmazonEKS_EBS_CSI_DriverRole
   ```

6. **Verified Resolution:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get pvc -n shortly
   # redis-data   Bound    pvc-abc123   10Gi   RWO   gp2
   
   kubectl get pods -n shortly
   # redis-xxx    1/1     Running
   ```

**Result:** "The PersistentVolumeClaim successfully bound to an EBS volume, Redis started with persistent storage, and my Shortly application became fully operational. I gained deep understanding of EKS-specific components like OIDC providers, service account role assumptions, and CSI driver architecture."

**Learning:** "This experience taught me that managed Kubernetes services like EKS have cloud-specific integrations that require proper IAM configuration. I now understand the importance of IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA) and how Kubernetes integrates with AWS services through OIDC providers."

### Q14: How do you debug pod startup issues?

**Your Experience:** "I've debugged various pod issues during my EKS deployment..."

**Technical Answer:**
Systematic approach to pod troubleshooting:

**1. Check Pod Status and Events:**
```bash
# Overall pod status
kubectl get pods -n shortly

# Detailed pod information
kubectl describe pod backend-xxx -n shortly

# Look for events (most important)
kubectl get events -n shortly --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'
```

**2. Examine Container Logs:**
```bash
# Current container logs
kubectl logs backend-xxx -n shortly

# Previous container logs (if restarted)
kubectl logs backend-xxx -n shortly --previous

# Follow logs in real-time
kubectl logs -f backend-xxx -n shortly
```

**3. Interactive Debugging:**
```bash
# Execute commands inside running container
kubectl exec -it backend-xxx -n shortly -- /bin/bash

# Debug network connectivity
kubectl exec -it backend-xxx -n shortly -- nslookup redis
kubectl exec -it backend-xxx -n shortly -- curl http://redis:6379

# Check filesystem
kubectl exec -it backend-xxx -n shortly -- ls -la /app
```

**4. Resource and Configuration Issues:**
```bash
# Check resource constraints
kubectl top pod backend-xxx -n shortly

# Verify ConfigMaps and Secrets
kubectl get configmap,secret -n shortly
kubectl describe configmap backend-config -n shortly
```

**5. Common Pod Issues I've Solved:**

**ImagePullBackOff:**
```bash
# Problem: Can't pull image from ECR
kubectl describe pod backend-xxx
# Failed to pull image: access denied

# Solution: Check ECR permissions and image URL
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-west-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 515966507719.dkr.ecr.us-west-1.amazonaws.com
```

**CrashLoopBackOff:**
```bash
# Problem: Container keeps crashing
kubectl logs backend-xxx --previous
# Exit code 1: Permission denied on port 80

# Solution: Changed nginx from port 80 to 8080 (non-privileged)
```

**Pending State:**
```bash
# Problem: Pod can't be scheduled
kubectl describe pod backend-xxx
# Events: 0/2 nodes are available: 2 Insufficient cpu

# Solution: Adjust resource requests or add nodes
```

**My Debugging Workflow:**
1. **Events first:** Always check events for immediate clues
2. **Logs analysis:** Look for application-specific errors
3. **Resource check:** Verify CPU/memory availability
4. **Network testing:** Validate service discovery and connectivity
5. **Configuration review:** Ensure ConfigMaps/Secrets are correct
