## Infrastructure as Code Fundamentals

### Q1: What is Infrastructure as Code and why is it important?

**Your Experience:** "In my Shortly application deployment, I moved from manual AWS infrastructure to Terraform automation..."

**Technical Answer:**
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through machine-readable definition files rather than manual processes.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Reproducibility:** Identical infrastructure across environments
- **Version Control:** Infrastructure changes tracked in Git
- **Collaboration:** Team can review and approve infrastructure changes
- **Automation:** Integrate with CI/CD pipelines
- **Documentation:** Code serves as living documentation
- **Disaster Recovery:** Rapid infrastructure recreation

**Real Example from My Project:**
```hcl
# Before: Manual AWS CLI commands
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-12345 --instance-type t3.micro

# After: Terraform configuration
resource "aws_instance" "shortly_server" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  key_name      = aws_key_pair.shortly_key.key_name
  
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.shortly_sg.id]
  
  tags = {
    Name = "shortly-server-terraform"
  }
}
```

**Bridge to Enterprise:** "This approach scales from single instances to complex multi-environment infrastructures with hundreds of resources."

---

### Q2: How does Terraform differ from other IaC tools?

**Your Experience:** "When choosing IaC tools for my AWS infrastructure..."

**Technical Answer:**
Terraform's unique characteristics compared to other tools:

**Terraform vs CloudFormation:**
- **Multi-cloud:** Terraform works with any provider, CloudFormation is AWS-only
- **State Management:** Terraform maintains state files, CloudFormation uses service APIs
- **Language:** HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) vs JSON/YAML
- **Community:** Larger ecosystem of providers and modules

**Terraform vs Ansible:**
- **Purpose:** Terraform for infrastructure provisioning, Ansible for configuration management
- **Approach:** Declarative vs imperative
- **State:** Terraform tracks infrastructure state, Ansible is stateless
- **Idempotency:** Built-in for Terraform, manual implementation for Ansible

**Terraform vs Pulumi:**
- **Language:** HCL vs general-purpose programming languages
- **Learning Curve:** Domain-specific language vs familiar programming concepts
- **Ecosystem:** More mature provider ecosystem in Terraform

**My Choice Rationale:**
"I chose Terraform because it's cloud-agnostic, has excellent AWS provider support, and the declarative approach matches how I think about infrastructure."

---

## Terraform Core Concepts

### Q3: Explain the Terraform workflow and core commands

**Your Experience:** "In my Shortly infrastructure automation..."

**Technical Answer:**
Terraform follows a predictable workflow:

**1. Write Configuration:**
```hcl
# main.tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
}
```

**2. Initialize (`terraform init`):**
- Downloads required providers
- Initializes backend for state storage
- Creates `.terraform` directory and lock file

**3. Plan (`terraform plan`):**
- Reads current state
- Compares with desired configuration
- Shows what changes will be made
- Validates configuration syntax

**4. Apply (`terraform apply`):**
- Executes the planned changes
- Updates state file
- Creates/modifies/destroys resources

**5. Destroy (`terraform destroy`):**
- Removes all managed resources
- Updates state to reflect deletions

**My Real Workflow:**
```bash
# My typical development cycle
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan -out=tfplan
terraform apply tfplan
terraform show  # Verify changes
```

**Advanced Commands:**
- `terraform refresh` - Update state with real infrastructure
- `terraform import` - Bring existing resources under management
- `terraform state` - Advanced state management operations

---

### Q4: What are Terraform providers and how do they work?

**Your Experience:** "When setting up my AWS infrastructure with Terraform..."

**Technical Answer:**
Providers are plugins that enable Terraform to interact with APIs of different services.

**Provider Configuration:**
```hcl
# Provider version constraints
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}

# Provider configuration
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-1"
  
  default_tags {
    tags = {
      Project   = "Shortly"
      ManagedBy = "Terraform"
    }
  }
}
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **Source:** Where to download the provider (`registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws`)
- **Version Constraints:** Ensure compatibility (`~> 5.0` means >= 5.0, < 6.0)
- **Authentication:** AWS credentials via environment variables, profiles, or IAM roles
- **Configuration:** Region, default tags, other provider-specific settings

**Multiple Providers:**
```hcl
# Use multiple providers
provider "aws" {
  alias  = "us-west"
  region = "us-west-1"
}

provider "aws" {
  alias  = "us-east"
  region = "us-east-1"
}

# Reference specific provider
resource "aws_instance" "west" {
  provider = aws.us-west
  ami      = "ami-12345"
}
```

**Real Implementation:**
"In my project, I used version constraints to ensure reproducible builds and configured default tags for all resources."

---

### Q5: Explain Terraform resources, data sources, and variables

**Your Experience:** "In my Shortly infrastructure configuration..."

**Technical Answer:**

**Resources (Things Terraform Creates):**
```hcl
# Creates actual infrastructure
resource "aws_instance" "shortly_server" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  key_name      = aws_key_pair.shortly_key.key_name
  
  user_data = file("${path.module}/user-data.sh")
  
  tags = {
    Name = "${var.project_name}-server"
  }
}
```

**Data Sources (Things Terraform Queries):**
```hcl
# Queries existing infrastructure
data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true
  owners      = ["099720109477"] # Canonical
  
  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*"]
  }
}
```

**Variables (Configuration Parameters):**
```hcl
# variables.tf
variable "instance_type" {
  description = "EC2 instance type"
  type        = string
  default     = "t3.micro"
  
  validation {
    condition     = contains(["t3.micro", "t3.small", "t3.medium"], var.instance_type)
    error_message = "Instance type must be t3.micro, t3.small, or t3.medium."
  }
}

variable "allowed_cidr_blocks" {
  description = "CIDR blocks allowed for SSH access"
  type        = list(string)
  default     = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
}
```

**Outputs (Values to Return):**
```hcl
# outputs.tf
output "instance_public_ip" {
  description = "Public IP address of the instance"
  value       = aws_instance.shortly_server.public_ip
}

output "ssh_command" {
  description = "Command to SSH into the instance"
  value       = "ssh -i ${var.key_name} ubuntu@${aws_instance.shortly_server.public_ip}"
}
```

**My Real Usage:**
"I used data sources to dynamically find the latest Ubuntu AMI, variables for environment-specific configuration, and outputs to provide connection details."

---

## State Management & Backends

### Q6: What is Terraform state and why is it important?

**Your Experience:** "When managing my Shortly infrastructure state..."

**Technical Answer:**
Terraform state is a mapping between your configuration and the real-world resources it manages.

**State File Contents:**
```json
{
  "version": 4,
  "terraform_version": "1.5.0",
  "serial": 42,
  "lineage": "uuid-here",
  "outputs": {},
  "resources": [
    {
      "mode": "managed",
      "type": "aws_instance",
      "name": "shortly_server",
      "provider": "provider[\"registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws\"]",
      "instances": [
        {
          "schema_version": 1,
          "attributes": {
            "id": "i-0123456789abcdef0",
            "public_ip": "54.123.45.67",
            "instance_type": "t3.micro"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Why State is Critical:**
- **Resource Tracking:** Maps configuration to actual resources
- **Performance:** Avoids querying cloud APIs for every operation
- **Dependency Resolution:** Understands resource relationships
- **Metadata Storage:** Stores resource attributes not in configuration
- **Locking:** Prevents concurrent modifications

**State Challenges:**
- **Sensitivity:** Contains secrets and sensitive data
- **Collaboration:** Multiple team members need access
- **Backup:** State corruption can be catastrophic
- **Concurrency:** Multiple users can cause conflicts

**My Experience:**
"I learned this when my local state file tracked 4 AWS resources, and I could see how Terraform knew which resources belonged to my configuration."

---

### Q7: What are Terraform backends and which should you use?

**Your Experience:** "For production deployment of my Shortly infrastructure..."

**Technical Answer:**
Backends determine where Terraform stores state and how operations are performed.

**Local Backend (Default):**
```hcl
# terraform.tfstate stored locally
# Good for: Learning, single-user projects
# Bad for: Teams, production environments
```

**Remote Backends (Production):**

**S3 Backend (Recommended for AWS):**
```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key            = "shortly/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-west-1"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock"
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- **Shared State:** Team access to same state
- **Encryption:** State encrypted at rest
- **Locking:** DynamoDB prevents concurrent modifications
- **Versioning:** S3 versioning for state history
- **Backup:** Automatic backups and recovery

**Terraform Cloud Backend:**
```hcl
terraform {
  backend "remote" {
    organization = "my-org"
    
    workspaces {
      name = "shortly-production"
    }
  }
}
```

**Backend Migration:**
```bash
# Move from local to remote backend
terraform init -migrate-state
```

**My Recommendation:**
"For production, I'd use S3 backend with DynamoDB locking. For learning, local backend is fine, but I'd migrate to remote for any team collaboration."

---

### Q8: How do you handle Terraform state conflicts and corruption?

**Your Experience:** "When I encountered state issues during my Shortly deployment..."

**Technical Answer:**
State conflicts and corruption require systematic approaches:

**State Locking Conflicts:**
```bash
# Error: Error acquiring the state lock
# Solution: Force unlock (use carefully)
terraform force-unlock LOCK_ID

# Better: Wait for lock to expire or coordinate with team
```

**State Drift Detection:**
```bash
# Check if real infrastructure matches state
terraform plan -refresh-only

# Update state to match reality
terraform apply -refresh-only
```

**State Corruption Recovery:**
```bash
# Backup current state
cp terraform.tfstate terraform.tfstate.backup

# Restore from backup
cp terraform.tfstate.backup terraform.tfstate

# Import missing resources
terraform import aws_instance.web i-1234567890abcdef0
```

**State Inspection Commands:**
```bash
# List resources in state
terraform state list

# Show resource details
terraform state show aws_instance.web

# Remove resource from state (doesn't destroy)
terraform state rm aws_instance.web

# Move resource to different address
terraform state mv aws_instance.web aws_instance.web_server
```

**Prevention Strategies:**
- **Remote Backend:** Use S3 with DynamoDB locking
- **State Backups:** Enable S3 versioning
- **Access Control:** Limit who can modify state
- **Automation:** Use CI/CD to prevent manual state manipulation

**My Approach:**
"I always backup state before major operations and use `terraform plan` to verify changes before applying."

## Advanced Terraform Patterns

### Q9: Explain Terraform modules and when to use them

**Your Experience:** "When scaling my Shortly infrastructure patterns..."

**Technical Answer:**
Modules are reusable Terraform configurations that encapsulate related resources.

**Module Structure:**
```
modules/
└── web-server/
    ├── main.tf          # Resources
    ├── variables.tf     # Input variables
    ├── outputs.tf       # Output values
    └── README.md        # Documentation
```

**Module Definition:**
```hcl
# modules/web-server/main.tf
variable "instance_type" {
  description = "EC2 instance type"
  type        = string
  default     = "t3.micro"
}

variable "key_name" {
  description = "SSH key pair name"
  type        = string
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  key_name      = var.key_name
  
  tags = {
    Name = "web-server"
  }
}

output "public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.web.public_ip
}
```

**Module Usage:**
```hcl
# main.tf
module "web_server" {
  source = "./modules/web-server"
  
  instance_type = "t3.small"
  key_name      = "my-key"
}

output "web_server_ip" {
  value = module.web_server.public_ip
}
```

**When to Use Modules:**
- **Reusability:** Same pattern across environments
- **Standardization:** Enforce organizational standards
- **Complexity Management:** Break large configurations into smaller pieces
- **Team Collaboration:** Different teams can own different modules

**Module Sources:**
```hcl
# Local module
module "web" {
  source = "./modules/web-server"
}

# Git repository
module "web" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/company/terraform-modules.git//web-server"
}

# Terraform Registry
module "web" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/ec2-instance/aws"
  version = "~> 3.0"
}
```

**My Module Strategy:**
"I'd create modules for common patterns like web servers, databases, and networking to ensure consistency across environments."

### Q10: How do you manage multiple environments with Terraform?

**Your Experience:** "When deploying Shortly to dev, staging, and production..."

**Technical Answer:**
Multiple environment management requires careful planning and organization.

**Approach 1: Directory Structure**
```
environments/
├── dev/
│   ├── main.tf
│   ├── variables.tf
│   └── terraform.tfvars
├── staging/
│   ├── main.tf
│   ├── variables.tf
│   └── terraform.tfvars
└── prod/
    ├── main.tf
    ├── variables.tf
    └── terraform.tfvars
```

**Approach 2: Terraform Workspaces**
```bash
# Create workspaces
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace new staging
terraform workspace new prod

# Switch between workspaces
terraform workspace select dev
terraform plan -var-file="dev.tfvars"

# List workspaces
terraform workspace list
```

**Environment-Specific Configuration:**
```hcl
# variables.tf
variable "environment" {
  description = "Environment name"
  type        = string
}

variable "instance_configs" {
  description = "Instance configurations by environment"
  type = map(object({
    instance_type = string
    min_size      = number
    max_size      = number
  }))
  
  default = {
    dev = {
      instance_type = "t3.micro"
      min_size      = 1
      max_size      = 2
    }
    staging = {
      instance_type = "t3.small"
      min_size      = 2
      max_size      = 4
    }
    prod = {
      instance_type = "t3.medium"
      min_size      = 3
      max_size      = 10
    }
  }
}

# Use environment-specific config
locals {
  config = var.instance_configs[var.environment]
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = local.config.instance_type
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "web-${var.environment}"
    Environment = var.environment
  }
}
```

**Backend Separation:**
```hcl
# dev backend
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "terraform-state-dev"
    key    = "shortly/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-west-1"
  }
}

# prod backend
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "terraform-state-prod"
    key    = "shortly/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-west-1"
  }
}
```

**My Recommendation:**
"I prefer directory structure for clear separation and different backends for each environment to prevent accidental cross-environment changes."

---

## Security & Best Practices

### Q11: What are Terraform security best practices?

**Your Experience:** "When securing my Shortly infrastructure deployment..."

**Technical Answer:**
Terraform security involves multiple layers:

**1. State File Security:**
```hcl
# Encrypt state at rest
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "terraform-state"
    key            = "terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-west-1"
    encrypt        = true
    kms_key_id     = "arn:aws:kms:us-west-1:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
  }
}
```

**2. Secrets Management:**
```hcl
# ❌ Never hardcode secrets
resource "aws_db_instance" "db" {
  password = "hardcoded-password"  # BAD!
}

# ✅ Use variables with sensitive flag
variable "db_password" {
  description = "Database password"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
}

resource "aws_db_instance" "db" {
  password = var.db_password
}

# ✅ Use AWS Secrets Manager
data "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "db_password" {
  secret_id = "prod/db/password"
}

resource "aws_db_instance" "db" {
  password = data.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.db_password.secret_string
}
```

**3. Provider Authentication:**
```hcl
# ✅ Use IAM roles (preferred)
provider "aws" {
  assume_role {
    role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/TerraformRole"
  }
}

# ✅ Use environment variables
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

# ❌ Never hardcode credentials
provider "aws" {
  access_key = "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"  # BAD!
  secret_key = "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"  # BAD!
}
```

**4. Resource Security:**
```hcl
# Security group with minimal access
resource "aws_security_group" "web" {
  name_prefix = "web-"
  
  ingress {
    description = "HTTPS only"
    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
  
  ingress {
    description = "SSH from specific IP"
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = [var.admin_ip]  # Not 0.0.0.0/0
  }
  
  egress {
    description = "All outbound"
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```

**5. Access Control:**
```hcl
# IAM policy for Terraform
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:*",
        "iam:*",
        "s3:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:RequestedRegion": "us-west-1"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**My Security Implementation:**
"I use encrypted S3 backend, IAM roles for authentication, and sensitive variables for secrets. All security groups follow least privilege principle."

---

### Q12: How do you implement Terraform code quality and testing?

**Your Experience:** "When ensuring my Shortly infrastructure code quality..."

**Technical Answer:**
Terraform code quality involves multiple validation layers:

**1. Built-in Validation:**
```bash
# Syntax validation
terraform validate

# Format check
terraform fmt -check

# Security scanning
terraform plan | tee plan.out
checkov -f plan.out
```

**2. Variable Validation:**
```hcl
variable "instance_type" {
  description = "EC2 instance type"
  type        = string
  
  validation {
    condition     = can(regex("^t3\\.(micro|small|medium)$", var.instance_type))
    error_message = "Instance type must be t3.micro, t3.small, or t3.medium."
  }
}

variable "environment" {
  description = "Environment name"
  type        = string
  
  validation {
    condition     = contains(["dev", "staging", "prod"], var.environment)
    error_message = "Environment must be dev, staging, or prod."
  }
}
```

**3. Pre-commit Hooks:**
```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform
    rev: v1.77.0
    hooks:
      - id: terraform_fmt
      - id: terraform_validate
      - id: terraform_docs
      - id: terraform_tflint
```

**4. Policy as Code:**
```hcl
# Sentinel policy example
import "tfplan/v2" as tfplan

# Require encryption for S3 buckets
require_s3_encryption = rule {
  all tfplan.resource_changes as _, rc {
    rc.type is "aws_s3_bucket" and
    rc.change.after.server_side_encryption_configuration is not null
  }
}

main = rule {
  require_s3_encryption
}
```

**5. Testing with Terratest:**
```go
// test/terraform_test.go
func TestTerraformExample(t *testing.T) {
    terraformOptions := &terraform.Options{
        TerraformDir: "../examples/complete",
        Vars: map[string]interface{}{
            "instance_type": "t3.micro",
        },
    }

    defer terraform.Destroy(t, terraformOptions)
    terraform.InitAndApply(t, terraformOptions)

    instanceID := terraform.Output(t, terraformOptions, "instance_id")
    assert.NotEmpty(t, instanceID)
}
```

**6. CI/CD Pipeline Integration:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/terraform.yml
name: Terraform CI/CD
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  terraform:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2
      
      - name: Terraform Format
        run: terraform fmt -check
        
      - name: Terraform Init
        run: terraform init
        
      - name: Terraform Validate
        run: terraform validate
        
      - name: Terraform Plan
        run: terraform plan -out=tfplan
        
      - name: Security Scan
        run: checkov -f tfplan
```

**My Quality Approach:**
"I use terraform validate and fmt in my workflow, with plans to add automated testing and security scanning for production deployments."

---

## Troubleshooting & Debugging

### Q13: How do you debug Terraform issues?

**Your Experience:** "When troubleshooting my Shortly infrastructure deployment..."

**Technical Answer:**
Systematic debugging approach for Terraform issues:

**1. Enable Debug Logging:**
```bash
# Enable detailed logging
export TF_LOG=DEBUG
export TF_LOG_PATH=./terraform.log
terraform apply

# Different log levels
export TF_LOG=TRACE  # Most verbose
export TF_LOG=DEBUG

terraform fmt -check -diff

# Generate dependency graph
terraform graph
```

**4. Provider-Specific Debugging:**
```bash
# AWS provider debugging
export TF_LOG_PROVIDER=DEBUG
export AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG=1

# Check AWS API calls
aws-cli configure set cli_follow_redirects false
```

**5. Plan Analysis:**
```bash
# Detailed plan output
terraform plan -out=tfplan
terraform show -json tfplan | jq '.'

# Plan with specific targets
terraform plan -target=aws_instance.web
```

**My Debugging Process:**
1. **Enable logging** to understand what Terraform is doing
2. **Check credentials** and permissions
3. **Validate configuration** syntax and logic
4. **Inspect state** for inconsistencies
5. **Use targeted operations** to isolate issues

**Real Example:**
"When my EC2 instance wouldn't start, I enabled debug logging and discovered the AMI ID was invalid in the target region."

### Q14: How do you handle Terraform resource dependencies?

**Your Experience:** "When managing dependencies in my Shortly infrastructure..."

**Technical Answer:**
Terraform handles dependencies through implicit and explicit mechanisms:

**1. Implicit Dependencies:**
```hcl
# Terraform automatically detects dependencies
resource "aws_security_group" "web" {
  name_prefix = "web-"
  
  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
  
  # Implicit dependency: Terraform knows this depends on security group
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.web.id]
}
```

**2. Explicit Dependencies:**
```hcl
# Use depends_on for non-obvious dependencies
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
  
  # Explicit dependency
  depends_on = [
    aws_internet_gateway.gw,
    aws_route_table.rt
  ]
}
```

**3. Dependency Cycles:**
```hcl
# ❌ This creates a cycle
resource "aws_security_group" "web" {
  ingress {
    security_groups = [aws_security_group.db.id]
  }
}

resource "aws_security_group" "db" {
  ingress {
    security_groups = [aws_security_group.web.id]
  }
}

# ✅ Break the cycle
resource "aws_security_group" "web" {
  # Define base security group
}

resource "aws_security_group" "db" {
  # Define base security group
}

resource "aws_security_group_rule" "web_to_db" {
  type                     = "ingress"
  from_port                = 3306
  to_port                  = 3306
  protocol                 = "tcp"
  source_security_group_id = aws_security_group.web.id
  security_group_id        = aws_security_group.db.id
}
```

**4. Data Source Dependencies:**
```hcl
# Data sources can create dependencies
data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true
  owners      = ["099720109477"]
  
  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*"]
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # Depends on data source
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
}
```

**5. Module Dependencies:**
```hcl
# Modules can depend on each other
module "vpc" {
  source = "./modules/vpc"
  
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

module "web_server" {
  source = "./modules/web-server"
  
  # Module dependency
  subnet_id = module.vpc.public_subnet_id
  vpc_id    = module.vpc.vpc_id
}
```

**Debugging Dependencies:**
```bash
# Visualize dependency graph
terraform graph | dot -Tsvg > dependencies.svg

# Apply specific resource and dependencies
terraform apply -target=aws_instance.web
```

**My Dependency Strategy:**
"I rely on implicit dependencies when possible, use explicit depends_on for complex scenarios, and always check the dependency graph for cycles."

        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::terraform-state-dev/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**My Team Workflow:**
"I'd implement feature branches for infrastructure changes, require code reviews for all changes, and use automated testing in CI/CD pipelines."

### Q16: How do you handle Terraform upgrades and migrations?

**Your Experience:** "When upgrading Terraform for my Shortly infrastructure..."

**Technical Answer:**
Terraform upgrades require careful planning and testing:

**1. Version Management:**
```hcl
# Pin Terraform version
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0, < 2.0"
  
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}
```

**2. Upgrade Process:**
```bash
# 1. Backup current state
terraform state pull > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tfstate

# 2. Test in non-production environment
terraform init -upgrade
terraform plan

# 3. Check for deprecated features
terraform validate

# 4. Update configuration if needed
terraform fmt -recursive

# 5. Apply in production
terraform apply
```

**3. Provider Upgrades:**
```bash
# Check current provider versions
terraform providers

# Upgrade providers
terraform init -upgrade

# Review provider changelog
# Update configuration for breaking changes
```

**4. State Format Migrations:**
```bash
# Terraform may prompt for state migration
terraform init
# "Do you want to migrate your state?" -> yes

# Manual state migration if needed
terraform state replace-provider \
  registry.terraform.io/-/aws \
  registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws
```

**5. Configuration Migrations:**
```hcl
# Before (Terraform 0.12)
variable "instance_types" {
  type = "list"
}

# After (Terraform 0.13+)
variable "instance_types" {
  type = list(string)
}
```

**6. Testing Strategy:**
```bash
# Test upgrade in isolated environment
terraform workspace new upgrade-test
terraform init -upgrade
terraform plan
terraform apply

# Compare with original environment
terraform workspace select production
terraform plan  # Should show no changes
```

**My Upgrade Strategy:**
"I always test upgrades in development first, maintain version pins in production, and keep detailed backups before any major changes."

## Behavioral Questions

### Q17: Describe a time you had to troubleshoot a complex Terraform issue

**Your Experience:** "During my Shortly infrastructure deployment..."

**STAR Method Answer:**

**Situation:** "While deploying my URL shortener to AWS using Terraform, I encountered a critical issue where the infrastructure would provision successfully, but the application containers weren't starting properly, causing health checks to fail."

**Task:** "I needed to diagnose why the Terraform-managed EC2 instance was running but the application wasn't accessible, despite the same Docker Compose configuration working locally."

**Action:**
1. "I enabled Terraform debug logging with `TF_LOG=DEBUG` to understand the provisioning process"
2. "I SSH'd into the instance and found the user-data script was executing but failing silently"
3. "I discovered the issue was in the automated deployment script - it was trying to clone the repository before Git was fully installed"
4. "I modified the user-data script to properly sequence the installation steps and added explicit waits"
5. "I used `terraform plan` to preview the changes and `terraform apply` to update the instance configuration"
6. "I implemented better logging in the user-data script to catch similar issues in the future"

**Result:** "The infrastructure deployed successfully with all containers healthy. I gained valuable experience in debugging Infrastructure as Code issues and learned the importance of proper dependency sequencing in automation scripts. This also led me to implement better monitoring and logging practices for future deployments."

**Learning:** "This experience taught me that Infrastructure as Code isn't just about resource provisioning - it's about understanding the entire deployment pipeline and ensuring all components work together reliably."
